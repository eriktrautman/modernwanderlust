  <p>
    My name is Erik Trautman and Iâ€™m a challenge-addicted entrepreneur, developer, dreamer, marketer, designer, photographer, athlete, analyst, data geek, quoter of Super Troopers and lover of all things obscurely nerdy or powerfully artistic.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spent half a decade building analytics infrastructure and trading on commodities desks from Wall Street to Houston before shifting gears into entrepreneurship. In 2013 I started <%= link_to "The Odin Project", "https://www.theodinproject.com" %>, a community-based web development program with almost 100,000 members.  In 2014 I founded <%= link_to "Viking Code School", "https://www.vikingcodeschool.com" %>, a fully online software engineering program where students don't have to pay until they get a job, which was acquired at the end of 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've also ridden through each of the lower 48 states on a motorcycle, most during <%= link_to "one epic trip", posts_path(:tag_filter => "Motorcycle Trip 2012", :order => "chron") %> in 2012, and a number of other countries as well during <%= link_to "another great trip", posts_path(:tag_filter => "World Moto Trip 2018", :order => "chron") %> in early 2018.  I ran my first triathlon in 2016 and completed a full Ironman a year later in Santa Rosa, California. I can typically be found hiking in Yosemite or dancing like a maniac to whatever's playing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm driven to impact the world through the creation of successful business while living meaningfully and well.  Come along for the ride.
