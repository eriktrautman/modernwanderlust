  <p>
    My name is Erik Trautman and Iâ€™m a challenge-addicted entrepreneur who is fascinated by the intersection of business strategy and product development with technology and markets.  I'm also a multi-purpose nerd and model-builder with a penchant for engineering, designing and playing with data.
  </p>

  <p>
    Too much time spent playing poker at Penn led me from the labs of engineering to the halls of Wharton and onto Wall Street.  I spent half a decade building analytics infrastructure and trading on commodities desks from New York to Houston before shifting gears to build businesses.

  <p>
    In 2013 I started <%= link_to "The Odin Project", "https://www.theodinproject.com" %>, an open-source web development community with almost 100,000 members.  In 2014 I founded <%= link_to "Viking Education", "https://www.vikingcodeschool.com" %>, a fully online software engineering program where students don't have to pay until they get a job. Both were acquired in 2017.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've also ridden through each of the lower 48 states on a motorcycle, most during <%= link_to "one epic trip", writing_path(:tag_filter => "Motorcycle Trip 2012", :order => "chron") %> in 2012, and a number of other countries as well during <%= link_to "another great trip", writing_path(:tag_filter => "World Moto Trip 2018", :order => "chron") %> in early 2018.  I ran my first triathlon in 2016 and <%= link_to "completed a full Ironman", post_path(id:"I am Ironman.") %> a year later in Santa Rosa, California. I can typically be found exploring new mountains or dancing like a maniac to whatever's playing.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm driven to impact the world through the creation of high leverage businesses while living meaningfully and well.  Come along for the ride.
