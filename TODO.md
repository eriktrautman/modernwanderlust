## BIG TODOs

* Get photo uploading in post bodies streamlined to S3
* Redo home page skin
* Redo site look-and-feel
* Get blog post thumbnails and indexing


### Photo uploading in post bodies

* Deploy!


Unnecessarily nit-picky fixes and tweaks:
* error handling for Post finds
* change from :id to a more semantic name for redirects param
* Add disqus for commenting
* Add basic test coverage
* Add an overflow-scroll to pre elements
* Set intelligent breakpoints for home page
* Sitemap for crawlability

## PHOTOGRAPHY PORTFOLIO

* Create new DB items for each photo with metadata attached and a link to the photo's URL on S3
* Prooobably want to implement some sort of S3 uploading functionality here...
* Look to 500px for inspiration.  Giant main photo, ability to locate other photos.  Store albums?  At least have tagging available.
